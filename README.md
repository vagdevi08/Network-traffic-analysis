# Network-traffic-analysis

Network-traffic-analysis tool is a powerful network traffic analysis tool designed to bolster security measures by detecting potential threats and anomalies within network traffic. Leveraging cutting-edge packet sniffing techniques, advanced data visualization, machine learning algorithms, and an alerting system, NetAnalyze provides real-time insights into network activity for proactive threat mitigation.

## Key Features

- **Packet Sniffing**: Captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time using sophisticated packet sniffing techniques.
- **Data Visualization**: Presents network traffic patterns and trends through interactive visualizations for comprehensive analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and security threats within network traffic.
- **Alerting System**: Provides timely alerts and notifications for suspicious activities, enabling swift response and mitigation measures.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and efficient analysis of network traffic data.

## Dataset
The dataset (network_traffic_anomaly_dataset.csv) contains the following columns:

- **timestamp**: Time of network activity.
- **source_ip**: IP address of the source.
- **destination_ip**: IP address of the destination.
- **source_port**: Port used by the source.
- **destination_port**: Port used by the destination.
- **protocol**: Communication protocol (TCP/UDP).
- **packet_length**: Length of the packet.
- **payload**: Data transmitted in the packet.
- **anomaly_type**: Type of anomaly (Normal, Intrusion Attempt, Port Scanning, DDoS Attack).
- **label**: Binary label indicating normal (0) or anomalous (1) activity.

## Usage

1. Run the Network traffic analysis application.
2. Configure the desired network interface for packet sniffing.
3. Analyze the visualizations and alerts to identify potential security threats and anomalies.
4. Take necessary actions based on the detected issues for network security enhancement.
